# publications-tbox-abox
This project involves creating a TBOX and ABOX for a research publication domain. The TBOX is generated using the Jena API for Java. The ABOX is generated with a data generator that satisfies restrictions. Finally, SPARQL queries are designed and executed in GraphDB for data analysis.
